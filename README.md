# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Movie Recommendation System. The system is built using data analysis techniques and possibly machine learning models to suggest movies to users based on various factors like genres, user ratings, and other relevant features.


## Contents

Movierecommend.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook that contains the entire workflow of the recommendation system, including data loading, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.




## Features

Data Loading and Exploration: The notebook begins by loading the dataset and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
```bash
•	Preprocessing: Various data preprocessing steps are applied to clean and prepare the data for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and more.
•	Modeling: The notebook implements a recommendation algorithm that suggests movies based on user preferences or similar criteria.
•	Evaluation: The performance of the recommendation system is evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and relevance.
```
